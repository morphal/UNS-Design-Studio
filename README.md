## What is this?

The **UNS Design Studio** is a hands-on learning and demo environment for anyone working with **Unified Namespace (UNS)** architecture, **ISA-95 hierarchy**, **OPC-UA**, **MQTT/NATS** and **industrial data modelling**.

It ships with a fictional five-division food manufacturer — 13 factories across Europe — all producing coherent, realistic process data driven by a proper plant state machine. No random noise. No hardcoded tags. Everything is configurable through a visual browser-based designer.

**Built for:**
- Engineers learning UNS and ISA-95 concepts hands-on
- Teams evaluating MQTT brokers, NATS or time-series databases
- Demonstrating IIoT architecture to stakeholders without real equipment
- Testing Grafana dashboards, Telegraf pipelines or digital twin tooling

---

##  Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) with Docker Compose
- Ports **5000** (dashboard), **4840** (OPC-UA) and **9999** (anomaly TCP) available

- OR, simply start the .BAT file in the app folder and point the app at an (MQTT / NATS) broker or other data consumer!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ilja0101/UNS-Design-Studio.git
cd UNS-Design-Studio
docker build -t uns-design-studio:latest .
docker compose up -d
```

Open **http://localhost:5000** fire up the virtual plants and start streaming data!.

---

##  Dashboard

![Dashboard with live MQTT data](docs/1.JPG)

The main dashboard gives you a live overview of every factory across all divisions. Each plant card shows:
- Running / Fault / Stopped status with colour-coded LED indicator
- Current OEE and power draw
- Active recipe name
- Good output tonnage and truck deliveries

The **Broker Bridge** bar at the top shows protocol, broker address, connection state and live publish rate. In the screenshot above the bridge is publishing at **956 msg/s** with **1,577 messages** delivered, and MQTT Explorer on the right shows the full ISA-95 topic tree with live values flowing.

### Plant Control

Click **Control** on any factory card to open the control panel:

![Plant control with recipe selection](docs/PlantRecipeSelection.JPG)

From here you can toggle the plant between Running and Stopped, and select the active recipe from the configured list. Changes take effect on the next simulation tick (~1.2 seconds).

---

##  UNS Topic Designer

Navigate to **http://localhost:5000/uns** to open the visual namespace editor.

![UNS Topic Designer — node properties](docs/TopicTreeDesigner2.png)
![UNS Topic Designer — node properties](docs/TopicTreeDesigner.JPG)

The left panel shows your full ISA-95 hierarchy. Click any node to edit its properties — name, type, description — and see the full MQTT/NATS topic path update live. Node types follow the ISA-95 levels: Enterprise → Business Unit → Site → Area → Work Center → Work Unit → Device.

### Tags / Data Points

Select a node and click the **Tags** tab to manage its data points:

![Tags tab with full production line](docs/SimTags.JPG)

Each tag has a name, data type, unit, access level, payload schema and simulation profile. The simulation profile column shows the assigned profile in green and is clickable to change it. The tag table scrolls — a production line node can carry dozens of tags covering OEE, energy, production, maintenance, quality, logistics, traceability and finance in a single view.

### Assigning Simulation Profiles

Click the pencil icon on any simulation profile cell to open the profile editor:

![Simulation profile dropdown — full list](docs/AddSimulationProfilesToTags.JPG)

Profiles are grouped by domain in an `<optgroup>` dropdown — OT / Process, Accumulators, Maintenance / CMMS, Quality / Lab, Logistics, ERP / Finance, Energy / Utilities, Recipe and Other. Each profile shows a contextual hint explaining its behaviour when selected.

The **Active Recipe** profile is in its own **Recipe** group at the bottom of the list:

![Active Recipe profile selected](docs/TagForLogingSelectedRecipe.JPG)

Any tag with the `recipe` profile will publish the name of the currently active recipe as a string — flowing through to MQTT/NATS like any other tag. Set the tag data type to **String** as shown.

---

##  Asset Library

The fastest way to populate a node with a realistic, pre-wired set of tags is the **Insert Asset Bundle** button:

![Asset library picker](docs/Add_simulation_tags_in_bulk_by_Asset_Library.JPG)

Filter by category (Rotating Equipment, Instrumentation, Storage, Utilities, Packaging, Process Equipment, Material Handling, Logistics, Quality, Maintenance, ERP/Finance, Energy, Production), click a card to select it, then click **Insert Tags**. The full bundle drops in with simulation profiles, data types and units already configured.

Available assets include:

| Asset | Tags | Category |
|---|---|---|
| Centrifugal Pump | 11 | Rotating Equipment |
| Control Valve | 6 | Instrumentation |
| Silo / Buffer Tank | 7 | Storage |
| Boiler / Steam Generator | 9 | Utilities |
| Packing / Filling Machine | 13 | Packaging |
| IQF Freezer Tunnel | 8 | Process Equipment |
| Conveyor / Belt Transport | 8 | Material Handling |
| Batch Reactor / Vessel | 10 | Process Equipment |
| Weighbridge / Truck Scale | 5 | Logistics |
| Quality Lab Station | 7 | Quality |
| CMMS / Maintenance Feed | 7 | Maintenance |
| ERP Production Order Feed | 7 | ERP / Finance |
| Energy / Utility Meter | 5 | Energy |
| Fryer / Pre-Fryer | 9 | Process Equipment |
| Drum Dryer | 9 | Process Equipment |
| Crystallizer / Evaporator | 8 | Process Equipment |

---

##  Recipe System

Recipes are configured per plant in the **Recipes** tab — visible when a **Site** node is selected:

![Recipes tab on a site node](docs/AddRecipesAtPlantLevel.JPG)

Each recipe in the list has a name and optional simulation parameters. The currently active recipe is marked with a green **● active** badge. Click **＋ Add Recipe** to add new ones, click the × to remove. Changes save to `sim_state.json` immediately via the API.

When a recipe is selected in the dashboard Control panel, `factory.py` picks it up on the next tick and adjusts its base simulation parameters — power draw, infeed rate, quality targets and availability targets — to match the recipe definition. So switching from *Naturel Kettle* to *Paprika Crunch* at a CrispCraft factory actually changes the numbers, not just the label.

Any tag with the `recipe` simulation profile publishes the active recipe name as a string topic:

![Tag with Active Recipe profile](docs/TagForLogingSelectedRecipe.JPG)

---

##  Broker Bridge

Click **Configure** in the bridge bar to open the broker configuration:

![Broker Bridge configuration](docs/BrokerBridge.JPG)

Switch between **MQTT** (port 1883) and **NATS native** (port 4222) with the toggle. Set broker host, port, optional credentials, topic/subject prefix and publish interval. The note at the bottom updates live to show the exact topic format that will be used based on your settings.

---

##  Payload Schema Designer

Navigate to **http://localhost:5000/payload-schemas** to design your message formats:

![Payload Schema Designer — Sparkplug B-like](docs/Payload_Designer.JPG)

Each schema defines a set of key-value mappings from source fields (value, timestamp, quality, unit, tag path, site name, data type) to output JSON keys. The **Live JSON Preview** at the bottom shows exactly what a published message will look like. Built-in schemas include Standard, Simple Value, Sparkplug B-like, ISA-95 Extended, OSIsoft PI-like and InfluxDB-like. Add as many custom schemas as you need.

Per-tag payload schema assignment is done in the Tags tab of the UNS designer — each tag can use a different schema.

---

##  Network & Server Settings

Click the **Settings** button in the dashboard header:

![Network and Server Settings](docs/Network_Settings.JPG)

Configure the OPC-UA bind IP, port, client host and anomaly TCP port. Changes are saved to `server_config.json` and take effect on next server start. For remote or Docker setups, set the client host to your machine's LAN IP so other OPC-UA clients on the network can connect.

---

##  Simulation Engine

Each factory runs an independent `PlantState` state machine:

```
                    ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
                    ▼                                  │
  ┌─────────┐   fault    ┌───────┐   repaired   ┌──────────┐
  │ Running │───────────►│ Fault │─────────────►│ Recovery │
  └─────────┘            └───────┘              └──────────┘
       ▲                                              │
       └──────────────────── ready ───────────────────┘

  ┌─────────┐   start command
  │ Stopped │────────────────────────────────────────► Recovery
  └─────────┘
```

Every tag derives its value from the assigned **simulation profile** and the plant's current state — no tag names are hardcoded anywhere. When a fault fires:

- Availability collapses; OEE follows (always `A × P × Q / 10000`)
- Flow rate and speed drop to zero
- Motor current spikes; vibration rises
- Power drops to ~12% (standby only)
- All accumulators pause

**Recipe switching** adjusts `_base_power`, `_infeed_rate`, `_qual_target` and `_avail_target` on the next tick. A FrostLine Steakhouse 14mm run draws more power and targets higher quality than Classic Frites 10mm — immediately reflected in all downstream tag values.

Per-division base parameters ensure a FrostLine frozen frites plant (820 kW, 28 t/h) behaves differently from a SugarWorks beet plant (1185 kW, 95 t/h) without any configuration.

##  Configuration Reference

### `server_config.json`
```json
{
  "opc_bind_ip":     "0.0.0.0",
  "opc_port":        4840,
  "opc_client_host": "127.0.0.1",
  "tcp_port":        9999,
  "host_ip":         "127.0.0.1"
}
```
> Set `host_ip` to your Docker host's LAN IP to allow OPC-UA clients on other machines to connect.

### `bridge_config.json`
```json
{
  "protocol":     "mqtt",
  "broker_host":  "127.0.0.1",
  "broker_port":  1883,
  "topic_prefix": "",
  "interval":     2
}
```
> Set `protocol` to `"nats"` and `broker_port` to `4222` for NATS native mode.

### Persistent volume
On first boot, `entrypoint.sh` seeds all JSON config files into the `uns-data` Docker volume. Subsequent container rebuilds do not overwrite your customised namespace or schemas.
